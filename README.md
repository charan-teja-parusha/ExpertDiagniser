The medical field is constantly evolving with new diseases and symptoms being discovered daily, which makes it challenging to diagnose medical conditions, especially for non-experts. To help with this, an expert system has been designed to aid in diagnosing medical conditions by asking a series of questions about the patient's symptoms. This system is for medical professionals and patients to better understand their symptoms and possible diagnoses.

The purpose of the expert system is to prompt the user to enter information about the patient's symptoms, medical history, and other relevant information, and then use a set of rules and knowledge to identify potential diagnoses and suggest further diagnostic tests or treatments. It is user-friendly and can be customized with new medical conditions, symptoms, and treatment options.
